# Off-Cuff
> Off-Cuff is a public speaking training tool. Its purpose is to help sharpen improv skills and feeling comfortable being uncomfortable.

> The basic Quick start will allow any user/visitor to quickly try out the app in it's simplest fashion. There is a premium interface tool for hosts/teachers to manage multiple participants in classes and [sessions](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions). This setup helps organization and provides feedback to the class as a whole.

## Quick Start

Quick start will be available for any visitors for free and with out signing up. By clicking the Quick Start button, the user will be directed to a quick run down of what's about to happen. The participant will be asked to press the start button. After the button is pressed, the slideshow begins.

### Quick Start Slideshow

The Quick Start Slideshow will contain 3 random images generated by an API (the number of slides can be changed if you are a premium users). These images will then be loaded into a slide deck much like PowerPoint. There will be a count down from 3-2-1, then the presentation starts. Once the presentation starts, the participant/speaker will have to improvise a speech. The speech will have to tie into the pictures in any capacity. each picture will be up for 30 seconds, timer provided, and then the next picture appears until all 3 pictures were up for 30 seconds (premium users will have a choice in how long the slides appear). Once the presentation is done, the user will have options to restart, explorer premium, or learn more about OffCuff.

## Premium users

Premium users are able to sign in create multiple [classes](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes), each with a roster of participants. Premium users will also have the ability to create multiple [sessions](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions) within each [class](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes) for students to participate in training [sessions](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions).

---
## Classes

Classes are created first by the premium user. The user will be able to create multiple classes. Each class will then have it's own roster of participants. Once they have a roster of participants, they can create [session](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions) with as few or as many of the participants on their roster as they'd like. Each class will have their own [retro](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#retro) as well which can be added to after any [session](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions) of the class.

---
## Sessions

Sessions will be where participants get added to a queue to preform their improv speech. This session can be completed in any duration of time, until all participants in the queue perform, or the session is closed.

---
## Participants

Participants will be associated with a [class](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes) that is created by a premium user/host. Participants will have the chance to improvise a speech in a [session](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions) created by the host within the [class](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes). Each participant will have a [retro](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#retro) available to them for feedback. The [retro](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#retro) will entail feedback for the entire [class](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes), not just the participant or [session](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#sessions).

---
## Retro

A [retro](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#retro) will be a form of feed back. It contains three sections, Start, Continue, and Stop. Start is what participants should start doing to help their speaking skills. Continue will be things the participants did well and should sharpen or hone in on and continue to develop. The stop is instances where the participants should stop certain actions or habits. The [retro](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#retro) will then be available to the [class](https://github.com/Off-Cuff/client#classes) from the host.
