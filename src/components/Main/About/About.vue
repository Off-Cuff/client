          OTC is a public speaking training tool.
          The end goal of OTC is to help you feel comfortable with the uncomfortable.
          More often than not you might be speaking in an unfamiliar environment.
          Sometimes you are fortunate enough to be in an environment that is familiar.
          Regardless of your environment, or level of preparedness, Murphy may still come and visit.
          In any instance, while public speaking, you should be prepared with a contingency plan.
          Well, we're here to help you develop a contingency plan for any instance of public speaking.
          By practicing your improvisational skills, you will learn to love the fact that you're unconfortable.
          If you dont, at least other can be entertained with your missery.

        <h1 class="">The Deck</h1>
        <p>
          The deck is essentially a slideshow.
          Think of your last power point presentation... just like that, but there's twist.
          What if you had to present someone else's presentation this time, with no preparation.
          This is exactly the feeling you'll get when you present from the deck.
          <ul>
            <li>Each deck is made up of 3 randomly generated pictures</li>
            <li>Each slide/picture will be on display for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>The goal is to improvise</li>
            <li>intro, slide 1, body, slide 2, conclusion, slide 3</li>
